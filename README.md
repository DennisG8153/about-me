Hi, my name is Dennis Grigoryev.
My email is dennisg8153@hstat.org
I got to the High School of Telecommunitcation Arts and Technology.
My schedule is English 3 (1st Period), Algebra 2 (2nd Period), Lunch (3rd Period) Software Enginerring [SEP] (4th Period), 
Chemistry (5th Period), Spanish 3 (6th Period), Big History Project [BHP],and Global History 3 (8th Period). 
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, I have 9th Period gym.
For a little about me, I'm all over the place. 
I can be happy and bubbly one minute and then dead serious next.
If you ask me for anything, I will accept and will help in whatever ways I can.
I am a student in HSTAT and am part of the school's theater and SEP programs.
I have one sister and we love one another, even if we don't see eye to eye sometimes.
I used to take swimming lessons from age 6 to 12, but I stopped after learning that they were repeating information.
